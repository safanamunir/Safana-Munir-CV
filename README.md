# Introduction
I have been retraining myself within web development for the past 6 months. I enjoy finding solutions, learning new things and have a talent for being able to streamline
processes.

I've recently certified from The Coders Guild in JAMStack Frontend Web Development to refresh my skills.

Currently seeking a Junior Web Developer role or other relevant job to get my foot in the door and start to get some real experience where I can develop my skills and
work towards my long term goals.
